## 🧠 About Me

Hey, I'm Artur, and I'm obsessed with AI and software. To me, it's fascinating how so many of the world's problems can be solved with just 2 hands, a keyboard, and practically no labor. This obsession has allowed me to build stuff I never could've imagined. Just a few months ago I developed novel attention mechanisms for spatiotemporal understanding that hit 99% accuracy in context classification, and a year ago I built a neural network for chip power consumption prediction that surpassed Synopsys's benchmark! I've done plenty more projects but decided to highlight these gems. Also, I speak 5 languages which I think is pretty dope :)

**Current Mission**: At Deloitte, I'm building next-generation agentic RAG pipelines that autonomously discover industrial threats by fusing vulnerability data with stakeholder evidence.

### 🎯 My AI Expertise Spans:
- **Natural Language Processing** 📝 - Conversational AI and text analysis solutions 
- **Computer Vision** 👁️ - Advanced image processing and visual understanding systems
- **AI Agents** 🤖 - Autonomous systems with decision-making capabilities
- **High-Performance Computing** ⚡ - GPU-optimized algorithms for large-scale AI workloads

## 🔬 Research & Publications

I'm currently working on spatiotemporal news analysis, with my latest [preprint available here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pcz5ckoBkP4wQ7ojY5r14g1LXoYaqL_1/view). This research includes the [SpatioTemporal News Corpus dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Artur-B/SpatioTemporal-News-Corpus) and [Space-Time-MiniLM model](https://huggingface.co/HaidarJomaa/Space-Time-MiniLM-v0), both available on Hugging Face.
